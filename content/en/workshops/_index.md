We have two workshops: 

 * Our [group workshop](multiplayer), also known as 'multiplayer', and
 * Our [self-guided workshop](single-player), also known as 'singleplayer'.

These workshops are designed to be separate entites, based on the number of participants (many, or one.)

### What are these workshops about? 

The ACROSS (**A**ttributing **C**ontributor **R**oles in **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware) virtual workshops are designed to: 

* Bring folks together from an open source community to identify what kinds of work and activities create, sustain, and foster their project
* Help projects improve how they identify and recognize of their contributor community
* Improve the overall visibility of the work needed to maintain open source communities

In these workshops we will walk you through the process to identify the work that is being done, then help you create or improve your existing documentation to make that work visible.
